Short analysis of changes for GroupSupport
--------------------------------------------------------
2011/10/24; mdobrinic

Group Support is realized in the same way that CSV and LDAP support is implemented, by importing users in the token-tables, that are used for entering a Survey.
Currently, LDAP and CSV are supported means to import users into the token generating process.
Token generation flow is implemented from admin/tokens.php
- Implementation in a Two-Step process:
  1. Show selection form
  2. Process import according to input data from selection form

Requires changing admin/tokens.php and duplicate the functionality in (sub)action-handlers 'import' and 'upload' for conext-groups:
- Action==tokens, subactions “importos”, “uploados”:
  1. subaction==importos: Selection form, shows all Groups the user is member of
  2. subaction==uploados: Request members of selected Group(s), create token records


* Changes described
Re-use the GroupRel-library
Copy 'GroupRel'-directory to $limesurvey/admin/classes
Create new GroupTokens.php file in /admin that interfaces LimeSurvey to GroupRel, and include it from where needed :
- tokens.php:$subaction=='importos'
- tokens.php:$subaction=='uploados'
- osgroup.php

admin.php : create new action “osgroup”, that includes “osgroup.php” as handler:
osgroup.php:
- subaction=form : render the form for the currently logged in user; action is called asynchronously by the group selector; uses GroupRel-library to render the form according to a template (php)
